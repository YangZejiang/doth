# Doth - Crypto Dapp Development - CeFi project.

In order to meet the urgent needs of users for money and solve the problem of user information leakage in the era of big data, we aim to develop a cryptocurrency financial and lending app based on blockchain and smart contract technology. Provide global users with safe, reliable, open and transparent, transaction-traceable, financial, and lending options.

The user can deposit cryptocurrency into the app and earn some interest.
The user can borrow money by staking their deposited cryptocurrencies.
The user can choose to repay in cryptocurrencies or U.S. dollars.
The user can withdraw the deposited cryptocurrency.

Every user transaction will be written on the blockchain to ensure the security of the user's transaction information.
